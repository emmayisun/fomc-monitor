        <p>Federal Reserve chair nomination live: Wall Street reacts to Trump’s Fed pick, Kevin Warsh, as hurdles remain in the Senate President Trump announced he will nominate former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed.</p>
        <p>If confirmed by the Senate, Warsh would replace current Fed Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends in May. "I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best," President Trump posted to social media on Friday. "On top of everything else, he is 'central casting,' and he will never let you down.</p>
        <p>Congratulations Kevin!" US stocks slid as Wall Street contemplated what the pick may mean for interest rates, while the dollar and Treasury yields rose on the prospect of Warsh as the next Fed leader.</p>
        <p>Trump's selection of Warsh comes after months of deliberation and after the central bank paused its easing of monetary policy, opting to hold interest rates steady in a range of 3.5%-3.75% on Wednesday at the conclusion of its first meeting of the year.</p>
        <p>Warsh has been critical of the Fed in recent months but is seen as a conventional choice for the role.</p>
        <p>Warsh has a background in the Bush administration, and he was appointed by former President George W.</p>
        <p>Bush as Fed governor, serving in that role during the financial crisis from 2006 until 2011.</p>
        <p>Although he is considered a relatively safe pick, Warsh faces an uncertain path ahead in the Senate due to potential Republican opposition.</p>
        <p>Thom Tillis, whose vote is needed to advance the nomination out of the Senate Banking Committee, reiterated that he would oppose any Fed chair pick until the Department of Justice's investigation into Fed Chair Powell is resolved.</p>
        <p>Follow along for the latest updates and reactions: LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 51 updates- Grace O'Donnell SoFi CEO: Fed Chair Powell's legacy is a 'wash' Now that some certainty has emerged around the next Fed chair, the era of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell can begin winding down, Yahoo Finance's Francisco Velasquez writes.</p>
        <p>According to SoFi CEO Anthony Noto, the results are essentially a wash — marked by a series of historic stumbles salvaged by a remarkably resilient US economy. "It's not always the path of how [to] get there, it's what the outcome is," Noto told Yahoo Finance, reflecting on a tenure rocked by unprecedented volatility and the COVID-19 pandemic. "People can poke holes on the margin about inflation and having to act sooner ... but [we've] been able to actually get back to somewhat of a stable economy despite that misstep on inflation," he added.</p>
        <p>While Noto described Powell's tenure as "phenomenal" in the aggregate, skepticism among market participants remains.</p>
        <p>He pointed to the Fed's delay in addressing transitory inflation, which prompted a 500-basis-point tightening cycle that many feared would break the American consumer. - Grace O'Donnell What Trump’s Fed chair pick Kevin Warsh could mean for mortgage rates Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: - Grace O'Donnell Here’s what the appointment of Warsh to the Fed could mean for interest rates this year Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: - Grace O'Donnell 5 questions for Kevin Warsh If confirmed as the next Fed chair, Kevin Warsh will be expected to balance the president's desire for lower interest rates with the need to fend off political pressure to maintain Fed independence.</p>
        <p>It's a challenge that Wall Street has clocked as it reviews Warsh's hawkish past. "I think the first question to ask is, Is Kevin Warsh a man for all seasons or a chameleon?" RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas told Yahoo Finance. "You know, he's traditionally leaned to the hawkish side.</p>
        <p>He certainly has some ... unorthodox views on the radical reduction of the balance sheet." Brusuelas laid out four additional questions that the Senate Banking Committee — and the markets — will be particularly asking in the coming weeks: - Grace O'Donnell Fed’s Waller explains why he dissented and wanted a rate cut While markets contemplated President Trump's Fed chair selection, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller opened up about why he dissented at Wednesday's Fed meeting.</p>
        <p>In a statement released Friday, Waller said that he views monetary policy as still "restricting economic activity" and said that "economic data make it clear to me further easing is needed." The Federal Open Market Committee voted this week to keep its benchmark policy rate unchanged at a range of 3.5%-3.75%.</p>
        <p>Waller was one of two dissenters (the other being Fed governor Stephen Miran), preferring to cut rates by 0.25%.</p>
        <p>Waller's issue with holding rates steady largely came from concerns about the labor market.</p>
        <p>He said Friday that the labor market remains week, citing the rise in the unemployment rate and slowing job growth.</p>
        <p>He also noted that he expects last year's data to be revised downward to show "virtually no growth" in employment in 2025. - Grace O'Donnell Kevin Warsh may still face hurdle in Senate Kevin Warsh still faces an uncertain path to the Fed chair role after North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican, reiterated his stance that he will not vote for the next Fed chair until the Justice Department resolves its investigation into Fed Chair Powell. "My position has not changed: I will oppose the confirmation of any Federal Reserve nominee, including for the position of Chairman, until the DOJ’s inquiry into Chairman Powell is fully and transparently resolved," Tillis wrote on X in a post that praised Warsh, calling him "a qualified nominee." Tillis's vote is needed to advance Warsh through the Senate Banking Committee.</p>
        <p>The senator, who is not seeking reelection, previously stated that he would oppose any Fed chair nominee until the DOJ probe was completed, citing concerns that the investigation was a result of political interference in the Fed's policymaking. - Grace O'Donnell Stocks fall, Treasury yields and dollar rise on Fed pick announcement US stocks fell when markets opened on Friday after President Trump announced he would nominate former Fed governor Kevin Warsh to lead the central bank.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.3%, pointing to another down session for tech stocks.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dipped below the flat line.</p>
        <p>The 10-year yield (^TNX) edged higher to 4.24%, while the 30-year yield (^TYX) rose to 4.87%.</p>
        <p>The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB), which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was up 0.3% to over 96. - Myles Udland Warsh a 'relatively safe' pick as Fed chair, but questions abound Wall Street is starting to weigh in on President Trump's decision to nominate Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve.</p>
        <p>Relatively. "President Trump’s apparent pick of Kevin Warsh for the next Fed Chair would arguably be one of the better outcomes for investors compared to the other contenders that had been in the running," Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, in a note on Friday. "Warsh’s long-running hawkish views should help to counteract concerns that he might morph into a full-blown Trump stooge.</p>
        <p>That said, his firm conviction that both AI and the Trump administration’s regulatory push will help to hold down inflation, as well as his longstanding view that the Fed should operate with a much smaller balance sheet, present the risk of some upward pressure on long-term bond yields. ...</p>
        <p>For now, the big picture is that Warsh seems like a relatively safe choice." Second, because of Warsh's time on Wall Street and previous experience at the Fed, there is a "degree of comfort" with the choice, according to Wells Fargo. "We know from our many client discussions that there appears to be at least some degree of comfort with a Warsh led Fed vs. the other choices," wrote Wells Fargo economists in a note on Friday. "But, we all should be mindful that there is also some degree of uncertainty associated with this pick if for no other reason than his public remarks on the economic outlook and the appropriate path for the federal funds rate have been fewer and farther between than the other finalists." And third, there are skeptics who view Warsh's previous hawkishness — i.e., preference to raise rates, or keep them elevated, rather than cut rates aggressively in a bid to life inflation — presents a longer-term challenge given Trump's clear preference for lower rates. "If you get a few cuts now to appease the President, you may well get tougher hikes later," wrote Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro. "Moreover, because Warsh has been a policy hawk his entire life, his newfound dovishness looks very suspect." - Grace O'Donnell Who is Kevin Warsh?</p>
        <p>Kevin Warsh, President Trump's pick to lead the Federal Reserve, is considered a known quantity for the president.</p>
        <p>Warsh, 55, is from Albany, N.Y., and received a degree in public policy with a focus on economics and statistics from Stanford in 1992.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Warsh worked in M&A at Morgan Stanley (MS) and earned a law degree from Harvard.</p>
        <p>Beginning in 2002, he served as a special assistant to President George W.</p>
        <p>Bush for economic policy and as an executive secretary at the National Economic Council, where he advised the president and senior administration officials on the US economy.</p>
        <p>Notably, Warsh has experience navigating the central bank.</p>
        <p>Bush appointed him to serve as Fed governor from 2006 until 2011.</p>
        <p>During his tenure at the central bank, he became former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke’s liaison to Wall Street during the chaos of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
        <p>As Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger notes, Warsh has been highly critical of the Fed, arguing that the Fed has overlooked the role of artificial intelligence in the economy and criticizing Fed Chair Powell for making "unwise choices" regarding inflation. - Grace O'Donnell Trump nominates Kevin Warsh to be next Fed Chair Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: - Rian Howlett Trump moves announcement of Fed nominee to Friday - Grace O'Donnell Trump says he'll announce Fed chair nominee next week Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: - Grace O'Donnell Fed may not cut rates again until midyear 'at best,' strategist says The Federal Reserve may not pick up interest rate cuts again for several meetings, as the labor market shows signs of stabilizing, economic growth runs at a solid pace, and risks of inflation spiking have diminished. "I don't think the case for rate cuts is going to present itself until mid-year at best and maybe not at all this year," Charles Schwab chief fixed income strategist Kathy Jones told Yahoo Finance.</p>
        <p>As my colleague Myles Udland noted in the blog post below, markets don't expect another rate cut under Jerome Powell's leadership.</p>
        <p>They have priced in another rate cut for the June meeting, after Powell's term as Fed chair ends in May.</p>
        <p>And although a sharp deterioration in economic conditions could cause the Fed to swerve, Jones noted that fiscal stimulus such as higher tax refunds from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could provide another tailwind to the economy. - Grace O'Donnell After the Fed meeting, what are the mortgage rate predictions for the next 5 years?</p>
        <p>After the Federal Reserve paused interest rate cuts at its January meeting, what does that mean for mortgage rates?</p>
        <p>Mortgage interest rates are determined by several factors, all of which can give us clues about the future.</p>
        <p>Yahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick explains how to forecast mortgage rates over the next five year.</p>
        <p>He writes: - Grace O'Donnell How the Fed decision affects mortgage rates The Federal Reserve kept its fed funds rates unchanged in its policy meeting Wednesday.</p>
        <p>While the fed funds rate doesn’t directly set mortgage rates, it does affect the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which directly affects what consumers pay when they borrow money, Yahoo Finance's E.</p>
        <p>Napoletano writes: - Myles Udland The next Fed rate cut probably won't be Powell's Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell's term is set to end in May.</p>
        <p>And at least one Fed watcher expects Powell has announced a rate cut for the final time.</p>
        <p>In a post on X, Renaissance Macro's Neil Dutta said that the only reason the central bank would cut rates before June is something "bad" has happened in the economy.</p>
        <p>With the Fed on Wednesday noting the labor market has shown signs of stabilizing, with Powell saying future rate hikes are not the base case for anyone on the FOMC, and economic growth expected to accelerate in the first half of the year, the next two meetings from the central bank are expected to come and go with no policy change.</p>
        <p>Which likely brings Powell to the finish line as chair without another announcement of a shift in the Fed's benchmark rate policy. - Grace O'Donnell Bessent: Trump's Fed chair pick may come 'in the next week or so' Markets are waiting for President Trump to announce his nomination for the next Federal Reserve chair, but they may not have to wait much longer.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger that his "inclination is we may hear something in the next week or so." President Trump said last week in Davos, Switzerland, that he intends to announce the next Fed chair "very soon." His pick is expected to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May.</p>
        <p>Watch the full interview with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent - Grace O'Donnell Fed Chair Powell offers 3 pieces of advice for his successor Fed Chair Powell laid out the three most important pieces of advice for his successor: The four frontrunners for Powell's job are President Trump's economic adviser Kevin Hassett, Fed governor Christopher Waller, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income Rick Rieder. - Myles Udland How much is AI responsible for a slowing US labor market?</p>
        <p>It's hard to say, according to Jay Powell Asked Wednesday about how the AI boom is impacting the US economy, Fed Chair Jay Powell offered a classic Powell response, nodding at several interesting possibilities and offering a conclusion that amounted to "hard to say." "So everyone of course is watching AI and the deployment and, you know, trying to understand exactly what's happening.</p>
        <p>And there's a wide range of possibilities," Powell said. "Anyone who uses [AI is] amazed at what it can accomplish, right?" Powell said. "So every technological wave will eliminate some jobs and create other jobs.</p>
        <p>And it's always been the case if you look back, wave after wave after wave, there will be some disruption.</p>
        <p>But ultimately technology increases productivity, which is the basis for rising wages. "And we may in any case see, in the short term, jobs that are being eliminated by the capabilities of AI...So how to think about it in in macroeconomic terms, it's very hard.</p>
        <p>We can analyze, for example, [that] there is some connection, it appears, between the low hiring rate for recent college grads and AI.</p>
        <p>But it's not the main or only driver. "You hear large companies saying, many of them saying, that they either won't be hiring for some time or that they're hiring less, or that they're laying people off.</p>
        <p>And they tend to refer to AI when they when they do that.</p>
        <p>So we're all watching and learning and it could it could certainly have pretty significant effects on the economy, the workforce, and our society.</p>
        <p>We don't really have the tools to address the concerns that may arise, but we have a lot of people who focus on analyzing it, and try to understand what the macroeconomic implications are, which which is our job." - Grace O'Donnell Tariff inflation expected to top out by midyear, Powell says Fed Chair Powell said he expects a one-time increase in consumer prices to work its way through the economy by the middle of 2026. "There's an expectation that sometime in the middle quarters of the year we'll see tariff inflation topping out," Powell stated in the press conference. A somewhat noisy reading of Personal Consumption Expenditures Index showed core inflation rising 2.8% year over year in October and November.</p>
        <p>While inflation has fallen over the past year, it remains above the Fed's long-run target of 2%.</p>
        <p>Powell stated that the inflation overshoot is likely due to higher goods prices related to higher tariffs, which he said is not expected to keep inflation elevated over the long run.</p>
        <p>Though inflation remains elevated, Powell said earlier in the press conference that he views inflation risks as diminished and policy in a "good place." - Brett LoGiurato Powell: Rate hike as next move is not 'anybody's base case' Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested that it is unlikely the central bank's next move would be a rate hike, after the Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday. "It isn't anybody's base case right now that the next move will be a rate hike," Powell said.</p>
        <p>Powell noted throughout his press conference that the central bank is monitoring risks to both sides of its dual mandate — employment and inflation.</p>
        <p>But his comments paint the picture of a Fed much more inclined to cutting rates, rather than raising them.</p>
        <p>Even if it's unclear when the central bank might start doing that again. - Grace O'Donnell Powell on Fed independence: 'We haven't lost it' Jerome Powell expressed confidence that the Fed will be able to maintain its independence in the face of growing political pressure to lower interest rates. "We haven't lost it," Powell said of Fed independence, adding: "I don't believe we will." Powell said that the separation between elected officials and central bank decisionmakers is an arrangement that "has served people well" is what's best for everyone and not select groups.</p>
        <p>He cautioned that once lost, Fed independence would be difficult to recover. "I think if you lose that, ... it would be hard to restore the credibility of the institution," Powell said.</p>
        <p>When asked if he thought the Fed would continue to maintain its independence, Powell replied, "Yes, I mean, I'm strongly committed to that, and so are my colleagues." - Grace O'Donnell Powell says there was 'broad support' for holding rates steady Fed Chair Powell suggested a consensus formed in the Federal Open Market Committee in the January meeting to hold rates steady, despite two dissenting votes by Fed governors Stephen Miran and Chris Waller. "There was broad support on the committee for holding today," Powell said, reiterating his phrase from the December meeting that the central bank is "well positioned" to view incoming data meeting by meeting.</p>
        <p>Powell also stated earlier that he views policy as "loosely neutral" or "somewhat restrictive." "Many of my colleagues think it's hard to look at the incoming data and say that policy is significantly restrictive at this time,” Powell said. “It may be sort of loosely neutral, or it may be somewhat restrictive.</p>
        <p>You know, it's in the eye of the beholder, and of course, no one knows with any precision." - Myles Udland Powell says won't 'expand on it or repeat it' after statement on DOJ probe On the evening of Sunday, Jan. 11, Fed Chair Jerome Powell issued a surprising statement saying a Department of Justice probe into his testimony given to Congress in the summer of 2025 was an "unprecedented action." Powell added, "The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President. "This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation." As expected, Powell was asked about this on Wednesday, with The Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos doing the honor.</p>
        <p>And, as expected, Powell essentially declined to comment. "I'm simply going to refer you to the statement that I made on January 11th. I'm not going to expand on it or repeat it," Powell said.</p>
        <p>Asked in a follow up whether the Fed had responded to subpoenas from the DOJ, Powell said, "I have nothing for you on that today." - Grace O'Donnell Powell: Lisa Cook SCOTUS case 'perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed's 113-year history' Fed Chair Powell addressed why he attended the Supreme Court hearing on Fed governor Lisa Cook's firing in the first question-and-answer exchange of the press conference. “That case is perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed's 113-year history," Powell said. "As I thought about it, I thought it might be hard to explain why I didn't attend." The case on whether President Trump could remove Lisa Cook from her role is considered a major test of the central bank’s independence and could reset precedent.</p>
        <p>Powell has also faced pressure after the Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation into him and the Fed. "I thought it was an appropriate thing," Powell reiterated about why he attended the hearing. - Grace O'Donnell Fed Chair Powell begins speaking at press conference Fed Chair Powell has begun speaking after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged. "The US economy expanded at a solid pace last year and is coming into 2026 on a firm footing, while job gains have remained low, the unemployment rate has shown some signs of stabilization, and inflation remains somewhat elevated in support of our goals," he said in his opening remarks. - Grace O'Donnell Loretta Mester: Labor market likely the catalyst for next rate cut Former Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester said she will be watching the press conference closely for updates on the labor market and for the Fed's thinking on what could lead to another rate cut.</p>
        <p>With the policy rate near neutral, in her view, Mester said deterioration in the labor market would likely be the catalyst for another cut. "It'll have to be something in the labor market, or more confidence that the labor market is really stabilized and inflation is on that downward path," Mester told Yahoo Finance. "But they're already near, very near, or close to neutral." Mester also stated that clear communication by Fed Chair Powell and the next Fed chair about the rationale behind the Fed's policymaking will be key to preserving Fed independence. - Brett LoGiurato Here's what changed in the Fed's statement The Fed's policy statement accompanying its interest rate announcement was little changed, though a couple of things stood out: The central bank upgraded its assessment of the US economy, saying it was expanding at a "solid" pace.</p>
        <p>It also removed a reference to job-market risks, a signal that it is watching both sides of its dual mandate — employment and inflation — equally closely.</p>
        <p>Here's a look at the key part of the statement. (Additions are bolded, subtractions are in strikethrough text.): - Grace O'Donnell Stocks, Treasurys muted in reaction to Fed decision US stocks and Treasurys were little changed in reaction to the Federal Reserve's interest rate announcement, which came as no surprise to the markets.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) briefly dipped but were roughly flat.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose slightly and was up 0.1% as investors awaited Fed Chair Powell's remarks.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose 3 basis points to 4.26%.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) also climbed, up 1.4%, but did not see a major move on the policy announcement. - Myles Udland 3 lines of questioning for Chair Powell on Wednesday The obvious questions that Chair Powell will face Wednesday will be around his decision to both disclose, and forcefully speak out against, the ongoing DOJ investigation into Powell's testimony given to Congress last summer.</p>
        <p>If his response to questions about Trump's power to remove him is any preview, however, Powell will likely be terse.</p>
        <p>The most pressing policy-related question facing Powell will be what could prompt the central bank to resume rate cuts, if the labor market has "shown some signs of stabilization" and the current level of inflation appears on the central bank is comfortable with, to an extent.</p>
        <p>And the third is how the central bank is — or isn't — thinking about the impacts of AI on the economic outlook.</p>
        <p>The AI buildout has certainly been a driver of GDP growth, and there are signs that labor productivity is also accelerating.</p>
        <p>The impact of the data center buildout is also starting to be more marked in credit markets.</p>
        <p>Late last year, the current even Powell spent the most time tying to Fed policy was immigration, which made the labor pool smaller and kept a lid on hiring.</p>
        <p>This year, we think his attention turns to the AI boom. - Myles Udland 2 Fed officials vote against Wednesday's action As has been the case over the last several meetings, Wednesday's decision from the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged was not a unanimous decision.</p>
        <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran, who joined the Fed's Board of Governors in September, voted in favor of a 0.25% cut.</p>
        <p>He was joined by Fed Governor Chris Waller in that vote.</p>
        <p>This also marked the first time since Miran joined the Board in September that he did not vote for a 0.50% rate cut.</p>
        <p>Miran was appointed to a temporary seat on the Board after Adriana Kugler resigned in August; his term is set to expire on Saturday.</p>
        <p>At its December meeting, three officials voted against the Fed's decision to cut rates by 0.25%.</p>
        <p>Those disagreements marked the first time since Sept. 2019 that officials voted against the Fed's policy decision on both sides of the argument.</p>
        <p>Waller, who has voted in favor of rate cuts back when the Fed was holding rates steady in early 2025, had not voted against the Fed's decision to cut rates since July. - Myles Udland Federal Reserve keeps interest range unchanged, as expected The Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to keep interest rates unchanged, with the target range for its benchmark interest rate remaining in a range of 3.5%-3.75%.</p>
        <p>This marked the first time since July the Fed did not vote to lower interest rates at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting.</p>
        <p>Two officials — Fed Governors Stephen Miran and Chris Waller — both voted to cut rates by 0.25%.</p>
        <p>In its statement, the central bank wrote: - Grace O'Donnell Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem weighs in on Fed independence after holding rates steady Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem warned on Wednesday that an erosion of Federal Reserve independence wouldn't just be a problem for the US — it would inc uncertainty around the world.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve "is the biggest, most important central bank in the world, and we all need it to work well," Macklem told reporters after Canada's central bank opted to keep its interest rates steady at 2.25% on Wednesday, as expected. "A loss of independence of the Fed would affect us all." Macklem's comments come as the US Department of Justice has opened an investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the Trump administration attempts to oust Fed governor Lisa Cook, and as trade tensions between the US and Canada have ratcheted up, with President Trump floating a 100% tariff rate on Canadian goods.</p>
        <p>Macklem said that the trade disputes have already caused "structural damage" to Canada's economy ahead of the renegotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement this year.</p>
        <p>He echoed a recent speech by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, saying that "days of open rules-based trade with the United States are over." On the monetary policy front, Macklem stated that Canada's financial markets are deeply intertwined with those in the US, so a loss of Fed independence "would particularly affect us." "Keeping the Fed operating independently, it's good for Americans, it's good for Canadians," he added.</p>
        <p>Read the latest updates about the Bank of Canada's interest rate decision. - Myles Udland Trump's search for a Powell replacement drags on with January deadline set to come and go With Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell set to approach the dais on Wednesday to discuss the central bank's latest interest rate decision, investors remain focused on updates around who President Trump may nominate to take his place.</p>
        <p>With a self-imposed deadline of January set to come and go with no update, reports in the last 24 hours suggest the administration is not quite settled on its nominees.</p>
        <p>And this despite the pool of potential replacements having been largely set for months. A report from Bloomberg on Wednesday noted BlackRock executive Rick Rieder — the current betting market favorite, according to odds from Polymarket — has made political donations in the past to candidates including Pete Buttigieg and Trump's GOP rival Nikki Haley.</p>
        <p>In a separate report, The Wall Street Journal detailed how each of the four finalists for the Fed role — which include Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett, and Chris Waller — have flaws when measured against Trump's clear preference for lower rates and the market's desire for the Fed to maintain its independence.</p>
        <p>The Journal also noted that Trump naming a nominee in mid-February "would be well within the historical norm for announcing a new chair to replace an incumbent." - Grace O'Donnell With the Fed expected to hold rates today, the question is when to expect the next cut Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: - Grace O'Donnell Stock futures mixed ahead of Fed decision US stock futures diverged on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision.</p>
        <p>Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) climbed about 0.8%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) rose 0.2%.</p>
        <p>Those on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) fell below the flat line.</p>
        <p>The 10-year yield (^TNX) hovered at 4.22%, while the 30-year yield (^TYX) rose 2 basis points to 4.83%.</p>
        <p>Investors have been closely watching the recent drop in the dollar, which has continued to fall despite expectations that the Fed would pause interest rate cuts.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, President Trump said the "dollar’s doing great," shrugging off concerns about the decline.</p>
        <p>The dollar index (DX-Y.NYB), which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, declined to 96.17 - Grace O'Donnell Rate plans from Trump's Fed candidates may not be so different President Trump is expected to announce his nomination for the next Fed chair any day, and his eventual pick is unlikely to significantly alter the Fed's existing policy path, BofA Securities senior US economist Stephen Juneau said. "They're probably all supportive of cutting rates more than maybe the current Fed led by Powell is, and cutting rates relatively quickly to, say, a 3% level," Juneau said of the leading candidates for the job.</p>
        <p>Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Fed Governor Chris Waller, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder are seen as the frontrunners for the Fed chair position.</p>
        <p>National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett is also in the running, though his odds have diminished after President Trump said he'd like to keep Hassett in his current role.</p>
        <p>All four candidates have expressed that they'd support further rate cuts, he continued. "So ... in terms of the general dynamic, it doesn't change all that much in terms of direction of policy." Trump selected Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve in 2017, but the president has increasingly criticized Powell for not slashing interest rates by as much as he would like.</p>
        <p>Juneau also stressed that the Fed chair has just one vote and does not set policy alone. "The composition of the Fed may not change all that much other than getting a new Fed chair, so it's really going to depend on what the committee's read of the economic conditions is, and how do you get a majority view in terms of setting policy rates," Juneau said. "That's really going to always come down to economic fundamentals, economic activity, inflation, the labor market." - Grace O'Donnell How the federal funds rate impacts CD rates Yahoo Finance's Ivana Pino writes: - Grace O'Donnell AI is becoming more and more salient for the Fed: Strategist Fed Chair Powell will almost certainly be asked about AI when he takes the podium on Wednesday. "The impact to labor market inflation is going to be so key for central bankers to try and navigate when it comes to their policy decisions," Principal Asset Management chief global strategist Seema Shah told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday, adding, "Certainly, that's a part of the narrative." Shah explained that while it's still too early for the Fed to start factoring AI into its policy decisions, the technology is something that the Fed and other central bankers will be researching.</p>
        <p>In the third quarter, US productivity growth surged to 4.9%, boosting US GDP growth and prompting some economists to point to artificial intelligence as behind the rise.</p>
        <p>But it's still quite difficult to measure how much of an effect AI is having in the aggregate.</p>
        <p>At the same time, AI productivity gains could also pose a risk for the economy in the short term. "If that AI boost to productivity is so significant that it causes job loss, that could be a problem for 2026," Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told Yahoo Finance.</p>
        <p>At the December policy meeting, Fed Chair Powell stated that the implication of AI would be higher productivity growth, and he also mentioned that he hasn't seen evidence of AI showing up in layoffs yet.</p>
        <p>But Powell emphasized that it's still "early days." - Grace O'Donnell Why the Fed is expected to pause rate cuts After cutting interest rates in the final three meetings of 2025, the Federal Reserve is expected to hold off on further changes to the fed funds rate on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>In 2025, Fed officials were divided on whether to cut rates to boost the cooling labor market or keep rates elevated to continue to bring down inflation to the central bank's targeted 2% level. A government shutdown that delayed and distorted government data on the economy only complicated matters.</p>
        <p>But now, as Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger previously reported, several prominent members of the Fed have stated that they view policy as being “in a good place.” An unexpected decline in the unemployment rate put the Fed on course to keep rates steady.</p>
        <p>In December, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4% while the US added 50,000 jobs, according to Labor Department data.</p>
        <p>Recent readings on inflation haven't swayed the Fed from that course.</p>
        <p>According to the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, the Fed's preferred measure, core inflation rose 2.8% year over year for a combined October and November period.</p>
        <p>The PCE report was a stale reading due to government shutdown delays.</p>
        <p>Core inflation measured by another index, the Consumer Price Index, remained at a sticky 2.6% in December.</p>
        <p>While inflation remains higher than the central bank would like, it has only moderately grown in recent months.</p>
        <p>Plus, some officials, such as New York Fed president John Williams, believe inflation will continue to come down after the "one-off" effects of tariffs wear off.</p>
        <p>With another government shutdown looming, the Fed could be entering another (partial) data fog.</p>
        <p>Still, markets will be listening to Fed Chair Powell's speech closely for any changes to the economic outlook and policy path. - Grace O'Donnell How a Fed rate cut affects checking and savings accounts Following three interest rate cuts in 2025, the Federal Reserve is back in its wait-and-see mode, Yahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick writes.</p>
        <p>Current thinking, as measured by federal funds futures trading, puts the next rate cut no sooner than June.</p>
        <p>What does that mean for the savings rates and interest charges that affect your money?</p>
        <p>Bundrick writes that 2026 continues the long stretch of modest earnings on deposit accounts.</p>
        <p>For checking accounts, the convenience of liquidity limits your earning power.</p>
        <p>The national average of interest paid on checking accounts has barely budged much this year and remains at 0.07%.</p>
        <p>Interest rates on savings accounts are only marginally better, remaining at 0.39%.</p>
        <p>High-yield savings accounts have been more effective at paying interest.</p>
        <p>Rates are still barely clinging to 4%, with some financial providers slightly above or below that.</p>
        <p>This is one category where rate shopping really pays off.</p>
        <p>Especially as interest rates move lower. - Grace O'Donnell Fed Chair Powell's comments will be the thing to watch The Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision seems all but baked in, but this week's post-decision press conference could hold more importance than usual.</p>
        <p>Markets will be scrutinizing Wednesday's press conference for information about the path of interest rate cuts and dissent within the committee — but also for answers on how Fed Chair Powell is thinking about central bank independence as pressures mount from the Lisa Cook hearings and the Justice Department's investigation into Powell himself.</p>
        <p>Powell will almost certainly field more questions on the political pressure, but Fed watchers expect that, characteristically for the Fed chair, he's unlikely to reveal much. “We’re not anticipating Powell to really talk much about it but to really be focused on the interest rate decision,” Principal Asset Management chief global strategist Seema Shah told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. - Grace O'Donnell FOMC meeting begins as scheduled The Federal Open Market Committee meeting began at 10:00 a.m. ET as scheduled, a Federal Reserve spokesperson said.</p>
        <p>The interest rate decision is expected to come down on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.</p>
        <p>As of Tuesday, traders priced in near certainty that the Fed would hold rates steady, putting a 97.2% probability on rates remaining at the 3.5% to 3.75% range.</p>
        <p>Traders saw just a 2.8% chance the Fed would cut rates by 25 basis points, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch. - Grace O'Donnell S&P 500, Nasdaq rise ahead of Fed meeting, Treasurys little changed US stocks mostly rose as markets opened ahead of the start of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) climbed 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively, at the open, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.7% on the backs of declines in health insurer stocks like UnitedHealth (UNH).</p>
        <p>Treasurys held steady with the 10-year yield (^TNX) standing at 4.22% and the 30-year yield little changed at 4.81%.</p>
        <p>The Fed will bring its first policy decision of the year on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>While it is widely expected to hold the benchmark interest rate steady, markets are watching for signals on the timing of future rate cuts. - Grace O'Donnell When is the next Fed meeting?</p>
        <p>The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, Jan. 27, and run through Wednesday, Jan. 28, when Fed Chair Powell is expected to deliver a statement and press conference announcing the FOMC's interest rate decision.</p>
        <p>The FOMC holds eight regularly scheduled meetings per year.</p>
        <p>After January's meeting, the FOMC isn't scheduled to reconvene until March.</p>
        <p>Here's the Fed's full meeting schedule for 2026: * Meeting associated with a Summary of Economic Projections. - Grace O'Donnell Will mortgage rates fall ahead of January's Fed meeting?</p>
        <p>Although mortgage rates often anticipate a Fed rate move, rising or falling well before the FOMC announces its decision, rates have found another motivator in recent weeks: President Trump's policy proposals.</p>
        <p>Yahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick writes: - Grace O'Donnell Central bank calendar: Bank of Canada to also deliver policy decision Wednesday The US Federal Reserve is among several central banks providing policy updates this week and next.</p>
        <p>Notably, the Bank of Canada is widely expected to hold interest rates at the same level on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>After cutting last year, economists forecast the BoC will hold the policy rate in a neutral position at 2.25%, though they are closely watching the renegotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) this year for clues on the policy path for the rest of 2026.</p>
        <p>Brazil's Central do Brasil will also hold a monetary meeting on Wednesday, while Sweden's Sveriges Riksbank and the South African Reserve Bank meet on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Next week, the European Central Bank's monetary policy committee is scheduled to convene on Thursday, Feb. 5, as is the Bank of England.</p>
        <p>The following day, investors will hear from Mexico's central bank, the Banco de Mexico.</p>
        <p>Many central banks, including the European Central Bank, Bank of England, and Bank of Canada, are considered to be in a cautious holding position as inflation has cooled but risks to growth remain. - Myles Udland The latest wrinkle for the Fed is a familiar one — a government shutdown As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported Monday, the odds of a US government shutdown coming at the end of the month rose sharply over the weekend.</p>
        <p>And after a 43-day shutdown complicated the Federal Reserve's task in the fall with data delayed or canceled, the same challenge could face the central bank ahead of its March meeting.</p>
        <p>This is the meeting, notably, that many on Wall Street expect to see the Fed cut rates again. "Should another extended shutdown occur, it would leave the FOMC in a tricky spot," wrote Wells Fargo economists Michael Pugliese and Tom Porcelli in a note on Monday. "The lack of visibility that arises from receiving limited economic data could thrust an already divided FOMC into a period of stasis.</p>
        <p>Fed officials lamented the lack of clarity on inflation during the last shutdown.</p>
        <p>We expect they would again use this argument to delay additional cuts.</p>
        <p>We have maintained that the window is closing for the Fed to cut rates again under Chair Powell, and another extended shutdown would not help." - Grace O'Donnell Treasury yields slip in start to busy week US Treasury yields declined on Monday while stocks and gold rose ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting and a busy week of Big Tech earnings.</p>
        <p>The 10-year yield (^TNX) declined 2 basis points to 4.21%, while the 30-year yield (^TYX) also dropped 2 basis points to 4.8% as the odds of a government shutdown rose following a shooting in Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>Long-dated yields continued to ease after a sell-off in Japanese bonds and geopolitical tensions led to a spike last week.</p>
        <p>While bouts of turmoil in markets and questions over Fed independence have created volatility to start 2026, investors broadly view the US economy as stable and expect the Fed to hold interest rates steady.</p>
        <p>Read more about Monday's market action in stocks, gold, and more. - Myles Udland Dissents to bear close watching While investors expect the Federal Reserve will make no change to its interest rate policy on Wednesday, how many FOMC officials vote against the action could emerge as the biggest headline from the meeting.</p>
        <p>In December, three officials voted against the Fed's decision to cut rates by 0.25% — Fed Governor Stephen Miran voted for the Fed to cut rates by 0.50%, while Kansas City Fed and Chicago Fed presidents Jeff Schmid and Austan Goolsbee both would've preferred the central bank keep rates unchanged.</p>
        <p>Both Schmid and Goolsbee issued statements in the days following the meeting to elaborate on their thinking.</p>
        <p>This also marked the first time since 2019 that there were dissents on both sides of the Fed's decision.</p>
