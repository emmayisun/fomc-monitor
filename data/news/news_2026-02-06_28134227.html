        <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Beson back on Capitol Hill facing the Senate Banking Committee where the focus quickly went to Fed Chair Jerome Powell.</p>
        <p>In a hearing with Treasury Secretary Scott Besson that was supposed to focus on oversight of the Financial Stability oversight Council, Republican Senator Tom Tillis used the forum to defend Fed Chair J Powell against the Justice Department's criminal investigation into him.</p>
        <p>Tillis, who has vowed to block President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsch to be the next chair of the Central Bank until that criminal investigation is resolved, cited a quote unquote list of members in the Senate who he said did not find criminal intent in Powell's testimony before this very committee last summer.</p>
        <p>The entire case against Senator Powell, um is encapsulated in his answers to questions before this committee.</p>
        <p>Um, and now uh including the chair, we have witnesses at the alleged scene of the crime.</p>
        <p>Uh having I mean, saying we're we're disappointed with Chair Powell. I actually like Wars as a potential uh chair, but we've all said that he was testifying and we didn't see a crime.</p>
        <p>Senate Banking Committee chair Tim Scott on Wednesday said he too does not believe that Powe committed a crime in his testimony.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, referencing comments that Trump made over the weekend, uh was asked Secretary Besant whether if Warsh did not follow the direction of the president that he would not sue Warsh.</p>
        <p>Can you commit right here and now that Trump's Fed nominee Kevin Warsh will not be sued, will not be investigated by the Department of Justice if he doesn't cut interest rates exactly the way that Donald Trump wants. I I that that is up to the president.</p>
        <p>Uh can you commit that you will I'm sorry. you can't say that he won't be sued if he doesn't drop interest rates and he won't be criminally investigated.</p>
        <p>Can can you commit that you will not hold up hold up can you The the president also made a political joke about you that I won't Separately, Besant was asked whether he supports the 10% cap on credit crate credit card interest rates that the president has put forth.</p>
        <p>Besant implied that he does and thinks that there is a way for banks to stay profitable if that was put in place for a year.</p>
        <p>He was also asked about the market structure bill that is going through the Senate right now as it relates to crypto and said that any company that does not support this bill can move to El Salvador.</p>
