        <p>Email us at whitehousewatch@ft.com Good morning and welcome to White House Watch from Washington, where the big event of the day is the first formal meeting of the Board of Peace, a governance framework set up by US President Donald Trump to oversee Gaza whose broad mandate could rival the UN.</p>
        <p>In today’s edition, we’ll be looking at: Latest White House broadside against the Federal ReserveJPMorgan Chase in talks to offer the Board of Peace banking services Trump slams UK plans to transfer ownership of the Chagos Islands — again The White House has taken yet another shot at the Fed, with Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, saying that the central bank’s economists should be “disciplined” for publishing a report showing US businesses and consumers are bearing the bulk of the costs from Trump’s tariffs.</p>
        <p>The study, released last week, suggested they paid nearly 90 per cent of the cost of Trump’s tariffs in 2025, with the burden decreasing slightly as the year progressed.</p>
        <p>Hassett, a close adviser to Trump who had been a frontrunner to be the central bank’s next chair, yesterday described the recent report from the New York Fed as “an embarrassment” and argued that it failed to portray the full breadth of Trump’s levies. “It’s I think the worst paper I’ve ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system,” Hassett told CNBC on Wednesday. “The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined.” He added: “What they’ve done is they’ve put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that’s highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn’t be accepted in a first semester econ[omics] class.” This is the latest attack from the White House against the Federal Reserve, an independent federal agency that the Trump administration has been criticising and targeting for months.</p>
        <p>The US president has attempted to remove governor Lisa Cook, who is fighting against the move in a case that is awaiting a decision from the US Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The US Department of Justice has also launched a criminal investigation into Fed chair Jay Powell, whom Trump has slammed for not slashing interest rates.</p>
        <p>The New York Fed declined to comment on Hassett’s remarks.</p>
        <p>The latest headlines The White House warned Iran it would be “very wise” to make a deal with the US as Trump decides whether to attack the Islamic republic.</p>
        <p>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been arrested at his UK home in a police raid following revelations about his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
        <p>Fed policymakers have warned that progress towards the central bank’s inflation target “might be slower and more uneven than generally expected”. JPMorgan Chase is in talks to provide banking services to the Board of Peace, including facilitating payments to and from the body.</p>
        <p>Trump has doubled down on criticisms of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s plan to transfer ownership of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, stressing the potential use of the archipelago’s Diego Garcia military base in any strikes on Iran.</p>
        <p>The Food and Drug Administration has allowed a key Moderna flu vaccine trial to proceed, a U-turn from a prior move to block the study that had triggered a backlash How should you navigate global economic risks this year?</p>
        <p>The FT’s Chris Giles answered reader questions in the latest instalment of Ask an Expert.</p>
        <p>Datapoint In our Thursday newsletter, Ian Hodgson’s Datapoint gives readers a visual representation of the issues driving US politics, from trade to the economy, political donations and beyond.</p>
        <p>Trump will travel weekly across the country to boost support for Republicans ahead of the midterms, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said at the end of last month.</p>
        <p>That blitz — should it materialise — would break the pattern established in Trump’s first year back in office, during which his travel away from the White House rarely strayed from Mar-a-Lago and his New Jersey golf club.</p>
        <p>The president spent just 81 out of his first 387 days on the road — excluding trips to Trump properties — according to an FT analysis of his presidential calendar.</p>
        <p>That’s down from 96 days of travel at the same point during his first term.</p>
        <p>The distinction is even more stark when limited to domestic travel.</p>
        <p>At this point in his presidency, Joe Biden had been on the road for 118 days, excluding visits to his Delaware properties, and visited 28 states.</p>
        <p>Thus far, Trump has visited just 17. “In his first year in office, President Trump has cooled inflation, secured the border, reduced prescription drug prices, negotiated new trade deals, and brought peace to the Middle East — and he’s achieved all of this while regularly doing public events, press conferences, and national media interviews.</p>
        <p>While Joe Biden hid from the public and even his own staff, President Trump has been front and center in this administration’s push to Make America Great Again,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. “We have a president who, in his presentation and arguments on the campaign trail, emphasised America first and prioritised at every turn domestic interests,” said William Howell, dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Government and Policy. “It’s significant that he doesn’t have teed up a whole slate of legislative priorities.</p>
        <p>If he did, he’d need more visits than he’s making to capture the attention of retail politics,” Howell said. “But that’s not the game he’s playing.” Presidents often tended to pivot away from domestic concerns and focus more on the international stage late in their presidencies, Howell said. “Making a difference domestically, there are all kinds of entanglements,” Howell said. “Presidents start thinking about their legacy and putting their stamp on history and, for a host of reasons, they have greater discretion on matters involving foreign policy.” The lack of travel may also reflect Trump’s expansive view of executive authority and grip on the Republican Party, said University of North Texas political science professor Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha.</p>
        <p>Much of Biden’s travel during the first years of his presidency was in an effort to build a broad base of support for his Build Back Better infrastructure bill.</p>
        <p>Trump, by contrast, unleashed a record number of executive orders in his first year in office.</p>
        <p>In his second term, the US president is facing popularity issues at home.</p>
        <p>Voters no longer trust him on the economy and his administration’s foreign policy endeavours and immigration crackdown aren’t popular with the majority of voters, according to polling from Pew Research. “If the president is going to be put in a position where he might have to address those policy failures, that’s risky,” Eshbaugh-Soha said, recalling the recent heckling Trump received during a visit to a Michigan Ford plant last month.</p>
        <p>Despite Wiles’s promise, Trump may continue to keep a lower profile ahead of the midterms.</p>
        <p>The sitting president’s party has lost seats in the House of Representatives in 18 of the past 20 midterm elections.</p>
        <p>An unpopular president could be an albatross around the neck of Republicans looking to hang on to their majority in the House, he added.</p>
        <p>While in-person visits can be effective in mobilising voters, the pay-offs may be diminishing, said Fordham University professor of political science Boris Heersink. “It used to be that the goal of having the president travel the country was to get people activated . . .</p>
        <p>The goal is less to the actual factory that he visits and more the local media coverage that you can get from it,” said Heersink.</p>
        <p>That surge in attention could once be leveraged to lean on members of Congress to pass the president’s priorities.</p>
        <p>Trump has spent more than twice as much time speaking on camera during this term than his last, according to an analysis from the Roll Call news service, and his use of social media has more than doubled.</p>
        <p>Using Truth Social to communicate his priorities probably doesn’t reach many voters, Eshbaugh-Soha said, “but it is something lawmakers and the media pay attention to”.</p>
        <p>Local newspapers are dying out and viewership of TV news is dropping off a cliff, Heersink noted.</p>
        <p>Once the bread and butter for retail politicians such as George W Bush and Bill Clinton, the strategy is no longer the best way to get the president’s message out there. “There might be less bang for your buck, flying the president out, than there used to be,” Heersink said. — Ian Hodgson, FT data reporter Viewpoints California governor Gavin Newsom seems to have won over European leaders.</p>
        <p>But Ed Luce asks: will US Democratic voters follow?</p>
        <p>Michael Strain urges the Fed, investors and economists to see more clearly the strength of the US economy.</p>
        <p>More than 10,000 workers with PhDs in science, technology and other disciplines have left the federal workforce amid Trump’s war on science, writes Anjana Ahuja.</p>
        <p>The ousting of Washington’s top antitrust enforcer ushers in a new era of US competition policy which leaves investors little better off, argues Sujeet Indap for Lex.</p>
