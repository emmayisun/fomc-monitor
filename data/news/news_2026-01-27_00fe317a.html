        <p>By Colby Smith Colby Smith covers the Federal Reserve.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to pause interest rate cuts this week after three reductions in the final months of 2025.</p>
        <p>Less clear, however, is just how long that pause will last.</p>
        <p>Fed officials, once worried about a weakening labor market, no longer appear to be in as much of a rush after bringing rates down to a range of 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent. A steadily growing economy and low layoffs have given them some comfort that they can afford to take their time with further cuts, especially as they stare down the prospects of another year of inflation well above their 2 percent target.</p>

        <p>Trump, who has not shied away from sharing his desire to fill a majority of the seats on the Fed’s board of governors with his supporters, is also close to announcing a successor for Mr.</p>
