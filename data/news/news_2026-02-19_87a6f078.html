        <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michael S. Barr issued a stark warning on Tuesday regarding the potential trajectory of artificial intelligence, outlining a scenario where rapid technological advancement will create a “jobless boom” that leaves a significant portion of the population “essentially unemployable.” Speaking before the New York Association for Business Economics on Feb. 17, Barr discussed the profound uncertainty surrounding how generative AI will reshape the labor market.</p>
        <p>While current data suggests a gradual integration of the technology, Barr urged policymakers not to underestimate the risks. “We should be clear-eyed about how painful these changes could be for affected workers and how challenging it would be for the government and the private sector to successfully manage the fallout.” He laid out three scenarios for how AI will impact the labor market, noting that predictions range from “the utopian to the apocalyptic.” The pace of technological change—and the resulting debate—is evolving quickly, though.</p>
        <p>In detailing what he termed a “scenario of rapid growth,” Barr described a future where AI agents replace a wide range of professional and service occupations, while robotics automate manufacturing and transportation.</p>
        <p>In this version of the economy, labor demand would concentrate in a few highly skilled trades or roles requiring human interaction, while capital holders and “AI superstars” capture the lion’s share of economic growth. “Layoffs soar, leading to widespread unemployment in the short run and declines in labor force participation over time, as a large share of the population is essentially unemployable,” Barr said.</p>
        <p>He added that such a future would require, among other things, a complete rethinking of workforce development and the social safety net to prevent gains from being concentrated among a small elite.</p>
        <p>Current signals in the noise Barr cautioned that this dystopian outcome is just one of the three likely scenarios that he sees ahead.</p>
        <p>He emphasized that, so far, the economic data is more consistent with a “gradual adoption” scenario, akin to the integration of the internet or electricity. (Federal Reserve researchers theorized last year that AI would more closely resemble the light bulb than any other technology.) In this view, while some jobs are displaced, productivity gains eventually boost real wages and create new industries.</p>
        <p>However, Barr cautioned that early warning signs are already visible.</p>
        <p>He highlighted research showing that young people and early-career workers in AI-exposed fields—such as software development and customer service—are already seeing declines in employment relative to other sectors. (Fortune has termed this “the Gen Z hiring nightmare.”) Barr noted, “For these workers, the short run may have long-term consequences,” citing the persistent earnings damage caused by entering a weak labor market. A delicate economic balance The governor’s comments come at a fragile moment for the U.S. economy.</p>
        <p>As of February 2026, inflation remains elevated at 3%, driven in part by tariffs, while job creation has been “near zero” over the course of the previous year.</p>
        <p>Barr described the current labor market as stabilizing but maintaining a “delicate balance” that is vulnerable to negative shocks.</p>
        <p>Goldman Sachs economists used nearly the same exact language a day earlier, as they projected that unemployment was holding steady despite weak job growth owing to nearly 800,000 immigrants leaving the workforce in 2026.</p>
        <p>Given these conditions, Barr signaled that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to lower interest rates soon.</p>
        <p>He explained that if AI drives a productivity boom, it would increase demand for capital and investment, putting upward pressure on the “neutral” interest rate.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the massive infrastructure build-out required for AI—including data centers and energy grids—could prove inflationary in the short term.</p>
        <p>Preparing for disruption Barr also outlined a third “stalled growth” scenario, where energy shortages or a lack of training data cause the AI boom to bust, leading to financial stress comparable to the dotcom crash or the railroad panic of the 19th century.</p>
        <p>Regardless of which scenario plays out, Barr concluded that the private and public sectors are currently ill-equipped to handle the potential speed of the transition.</p>
        <p>He warned that the “historical record on meaningful efforts to help workers in such a transition is not encouraging.” “Society will need to be nimble and bold to reduce the pain of short-term dislocations,” Barr said. “Widespread AI adoption will very likely lead to dramatic and sometimes difficult changes in the way many of us work and live.”</p>
