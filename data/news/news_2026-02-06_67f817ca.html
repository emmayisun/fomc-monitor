        <p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell Just Gave Good News About the Economy -- and Bad News to President Donald Trump Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell concluded the Fed's January meeting, as he always does, with a press conference to go over the Fed's recent actions and answer reporters' questions about the economy.</p>
        <p>The market keeps a close eye on these press conferences, looking for clues about future interest rate and balance-sheet moves by the Fed.</p>
        <p>At the Fed's recent meeting and during the press conference, Powell provided a positive update about the economy, but that was likely bad news for President Donald Trump, who has been at odds with the Fed since the beginning of his second term.</p>
        <p>Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor.</p>
        <p>See the stocks » A positive update on the economy and the labor market During the post-meeting press conference, Powell essentially issued positive updates on the strength of the economy, inflation, and the labor market.</p>
        <p>On inflation, Powell said the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors has observed disinflation in the services sector.</p>
        <p>However, inflation in the goods sector is still elevated due to tariffs.</p>
        <p>Long-term inflation expectations are still within the Fed's preferred 2% target.</p>
        <p>Powell also said that data show solid economic activity continuing to surprise positively.</p>
        <p>Consumers remain resilient, and businesses are also continuing to boost investments, although Powell noted that housing remains a weak spot.</p>
        <p>Powell also believes the government shutdown likely weighed on economic activity, but he expects a reversal this quarter.</p>
        <p>Finally, Powell noted that labor market data suggest that things may be stabilizing after experiencing some softening in the months prior.</p>
        <p>While job growth is slowing, much of this can be attributed to slower growth in the number of available workers, driven by lower immigration and lower labor force participation, although labor demand is still weak.</p>
        <p>Job openings, layoffs, hiring, and nominal wage growth have not changed much in recent months.</p>
        <p>Bad news for Trump So why is a positive update on the economy and labor market bad news for Trump?</p>
        <p>The 47th president has been quite vocal in his desire for the Fed to lower interest rates.</p>
        <p>This data is not supportive of further rate cuts, especially on the labor side.</p>
        <p>The Fed's dual mandate calls for stable prices and maximum employment.</p>
        <p>But prices are still high, and inflation, at 3% in January, is still high.</p>
        <p>If the Fed continues to lower rates, it will continue to stimulate the economy and risk increasing inflation more.</p>
        <p>However, the Fed has also been watching the labor market, as unemployment has risen.</p>
