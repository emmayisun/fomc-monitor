        <p>Two new voting members on the Federal Reserve this year said Tuesday they would prefer to hold rates steady for now because of concerns about inflation. "I believe monetary policy is in a good place to stay on hold as we assess the incoming data and weigh if, and how, policy may need to adjust further," Cleveland Fed president Beth Hammack said Tuesday at the Ohio Bankers League Economic Summit in Columbus, Ohio. "Based on my forecast, we could be on hold for quite some time," she said.</p>
        <p>Hammack said inflation is still too high and has largely moved sideways for more than two years.</p>
        <p>She sees a risk that inflation could persist near 3% this year, as it has for the past two years.</p>
        <p>Hammack said she needs to see decisive evidence that prices are coming down.</p>
        <p>And rather than try to "fine-tune" interest rates, Hammack said she'd prefer to "err on the side of patience" as the Fed assesses the impact of three rate cuts from last fall and economic growth.</p>
        <p>Right now, she sees the Fed's benchmark policy rate in the vicinity of neutral, meaning it's not meaningfully restraining the economy.</p>
        <p>Hammack said she sees the risks of a higher or lower path for the rates as about balanced.</p>
        <p>While her outlook does anticipate some easing in inflation over the course of this year, Hammack said she is monitoring the impact of tariffs on prices.</p>
        <p>She said companies have told her increases in tariff rates have pushed up their costs, and while some businesses have already passed along those costs, others said more price increases are coming.</p>
        <p>Hammack also pointed to rising prices of electricity and health insurance. "At this point, it's too soon to say if these broad cost pressures have peaked," she said.</p>

"Right now, I am more worried about inflation remaining stubbornly high," Logan said in a speech in Austin, Texas. "We will learn in coming months whether inflation is coming down to our target and whether the labor market will remain stable," she said. "If so, this would tell me that our current policy stance is appropriate and no further rate cuts are needed to achieve our dual mandate goals." Logan added that if inflation comes down but the job market cools further, "cutting rates again could become appropriate."</p>
