        <p>The Federal Reserve has voted to hold interest rates where they are at its January FOMC meeting on Wednesday, the decision to be followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Yahoo Finance Senior Fed Reporter Jennifer Schonberger comes on Market Domination to discuss this decision and the US central bank's outlook on inflation and the likelihood of future rate cuts.</p>
        <p>To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve holding rates steady in the range of 3 and a half to 3 and 3/4 percent.</p>
        <p>Fed Federal Reserve Governors Steven Myron and Chris Waller both dissenting, preferring to cut rates by a quarter percentage point.</p>
        <p>Waller had indicated ahead of the meeting that he still has concerns about the health of the job market.</p>
        <p>Now, Fed officials upgraded their assessment of the economy to solid from moderate on the back of that strong third quarter GDP reading expectations for a strong fourth quarter as well.</p>
        <p>They see inflation as quote, somewhat elevated, and said the job market is showing quote, some signs of stabilization.</p>
        <p>Notably, they dropped language from their statement that said that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.</p>
        <p>The statement simply reading now that the committee is attentive to risks to both sides of its dual mandate.</p>
        <p>Now, when it comes to the path for future cuts, officials reiterated in their statement that quote, in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments, they will be attentive to incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
        <p>One, that Myron descended in favor of a 25 basis point cut.</p>
        <p>And that Waller joined that dissent, which is especially interesting given the backdrop that President Trump has still not made his decision of who's going to be his nominee for next chair of the Federal Reserve.</p>
        <p>Julia, I am so glad that you brought that up because I was literally in the lock up looking at who voted in favor for this decision and who voted against.</p>
        <p>And I thought it was very telling to your point that Chris Waller descended because he is still on the short list for Fed chair.</p>
        <p>And she gave a speech two weeks ago that seemed to lay the case for a clear cut rate cut.</p>
        <p>And the fact that she did not dissent, it was also telling, she's not on that short list anymore.</p>
        <p>And we know that Governor Steve Myron thinks that they should move faster to where he sees neutral.</p>
        <p>He sees neutral a lot lower than where rates are right now.</p>
        <p>The fact that he feels like they could slow down a little bit at this point is also interesting.</p>
        <p>Maybe that speaks to the strength and the pickup that we've been seeing in the economy, the fact that officials have upgraded their assessment for the economy.</p>
        <p>They say now economic conditions are solid, they're not moderate.</p>
        <p>They've also upgraded the the outlook for the job market, which is why they cut three times last year, right?</p>
